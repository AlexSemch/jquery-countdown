This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/jquery-countdown/ as the original author hasn't updated the project since 10th July 2009.

Improvements from the original code base:

* startTime can be dd:hh:mm:ss or a date object.
* Automatically detect format of startTime.
* Zero pad numbers if needed.
